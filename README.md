# SPEECH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM-TASK-2
üóÇÔ∏è PROJECT TITLE:
        Speech Recognition System using Pre-trained Wav2Vec2.0 Model

üéØ OBJECTIVE:
    The goal of this project is to build a functional speech recognition system that transcribes spoken audio from a .wav file into readable text using pre-trained machine learning models. This fulfills the requirement to create a speech-to-text system as part of the CODTECH internship program.

üìñ INTRODUCTION:
      Speech Recognition is one of the most significant applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It converts spoken language into written text and is widely used in voice assistants, transcription software, and accessibility tools.
      In this project, we utilize the Wav2Vec2 model ‚Äî a state-of-the-art, transformer-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model from Facebook AI ‚Äî made available via Hugging Face's transformers library.
      The goal is to use this model to convert short audio clips to text without training the model from scratch.

üß∞ TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED:
    Tool/Library	                                          Purpose

    Torchaudio	                                Audio backend support for PyTorch
    FFmpeg	                                    Audio conversion to mono/16kHz WAV
    VS Code / PyCharm	                          Optional for development and editing

 üíª SYSTEM REQURIMENTS:
Python ‚â• 3.8
pip (Python package installer)
Internet (for downloading model)
Audio File (.wav, 16-bit PCM, mono, 16000Hz)
 
 üìÅ FILE STRUCTURE:
speech_recognition_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stt_with_wav2vec.py               # Main script using Wav2Vec2
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audio.wav                         # Sample audio file for transcription
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                         # Documentation (this file)

üì¶ INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
Install Python dependencies
    pip install transformers torchaudio soundfile
Convert audio file (if needed)
    ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ac 1 -ar 16000 audio.wav
Download model (automatic on first run)
    The Hugging Face pipeline will automatically download the Wav2Vec2.0 model.
    
üìú CODE EXPLANATION:
from transformers import pipeline

# Define a function for transcription
def transcribe_with_wav2vec(audio_file):
    print("[INFO] Loading Wav2Vec2 model...")
    asr_pipeline = pipeline("automatic-speech-recognition")

    print("[INFO] Transcribing...")
    result = asr_pipeline(audio_file)

    print("\n>> TRANSCRIPTION RESULT:\n")
    print(result["text"])

# Run only if script is executed directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    transcribe_with_wav2vec("audio.wav")
    
üîç CODE BREAKDOWN:
pipeline("automatic-speech-recognition"): Loads a pre-trained Wav2Vec2 model.

result = asr_pipeline(audio_file): Applies the model to the audio file.

print(result["text"]): Outputs the transcription.

üéô INPUT AND üìù OUTPUT:
Input:
    Short audio file (.wav)
    Format: mono channel, 16-bit, 16kHz sample rate
Output:
    Console output of recognized speech

‚úÖ FEATURES:
‚úî Uses state-of-the-art Wav2Vec2.0 model
‚úî No training required (pre-trained)
‚úî Transcribes speech to text
‚úî Lightweight and fast
‚úî Works on short clips with high accuracy
‚úî Easy to extend into real-time systems

üîß SAMPLE USE CASE:
A .wav file with the phrase:
üéß ‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôm testing this speech recognition system.‚Äù

Transcription Output:
[INFO] Loading Wav2Vec2 model...
[INFO] Transcribing...

>> TRANSCRIPTION RESULT:

Hello I‚Äôm testing this speech recognition system.

‚ö†Ô∏è LIMITATIONS:
          Limitation	                                          Description
    No real-time processing                	            Works with saved audio only
    Sensitive to noise	                             Performance drops with noisy audio
    Only English (default)	                        Needs multilingual model for other langs
    Requires conversion of audio format	            Must be mono WAV with correct sampling

üöÄ FUTURE SCOPE:
Add a microphone recorder using speech_recognition or pyaudio
Build a GUI using Tkinter or Streamlit
Export transcription to .txt, .docx, or .pdf
Add language detection and multilingual support
Deploy on web using Flask or FastAPI

üìú CONCLUSION:
    This project demonstrates the power of using pre-trained transformer-based models like Wav2Vec2.0 to perform accurate and fast speech recognition. It lays the foundation for building more complex applications like voice-controlled interfaces, real-time dictation tools, or assistive technologies.
    This project successfully implements a speech-to-text transcription tool using Facebook‚Äôs Wav2Vec2 model via Hugging Face Transformers. The tool is effective, easy to use, and serves as a foundation for more advanced voice-based systems such as voice assistants, transcription apps, and accessibility services.
    It fulfills the core internship requirement to build a functional STT system using pre-trained models.
